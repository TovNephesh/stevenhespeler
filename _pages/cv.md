## Work Experience
---
**June 2023 – Present: Data Scientist, Computers and Computer Science Directorate, Mathematics in Computation Section**  
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)  
* Conducting research on Controller Area Network (CAN) data with a focus on time-series cross-validation (TSCV) and anomaly detection. The work applies machine learning techniques for the analysis of time-series data collected from automotive and other cyber-physical systems, and involves optimization and evaluation of model performance in the context of fault detection in vehicle CAN systems.

**Jan 2021 – May 2023: Data Scientist, Civil Engineering Department**  
New Mexico State University, Department of Civil Engineering  
* Focused on applying Deep Learning techniques to civil engineering problems, such as predictive modeling and sensor data analysis in civil infrastructure systems. Contributed to research that involved using acoustic emissions and ultrasound signals for structural health monitoring, and developed algorithms for real-time analysis of these signals.

**Fall 2020: Research Assistant**  
New Mexico State University, Department of Civil Engineering  
* Conducted research on Deep Learning techniques applied to civil engineering applications, particularly in predictive modeling and sensor data analysis.

**Spring 2018: Graduate Assistant**  
New Mexico State University  
* Monitored 3D printing lab and provided support in the development and execution of 3D printing projects.

**Fall/Summer 2017: Graduate Assistant**  
New Mexico State University  
* Assisted in lab operations, managing and guiding students in 3D printing technologies and applications.
