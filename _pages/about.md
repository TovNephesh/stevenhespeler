Hello! I'm Steven Hespeler, welcome to my personal page! I recently completed my doctoral degree at New Mexico State University. Here, you'll find some information about me like my research interests, professional CV, publications, and more. Thank you for visiting and please contact me with any inquires!! Have a great day!!

## My Research and Work
My work focuses on machine learning and statistical analysis. My dissertation explored the application of advanced Deep Learning (DL) techniques to predict the State of Charge (SOC) in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). To achieve this, I developed a Continuous Lag Control (CLC) algorithm for managing and adjusting the size of the training data in Time-Series Cross Validation (TSCV) methods, embedding it within a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. Currently, I am involved in a postdoctoral project that bridges the fields of machine learning and cybersecurity for automotive cyber-physical systems.
