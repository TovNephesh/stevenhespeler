Hello! I'm Steven Hespeler, welcome to my personal page! I recently completed my doctoral degree at New Mexico State University. Here, you'll find some information about me like my research interests, professional CV, publications, and more. Thank you for visiting and have a great day!!

## My Research and Work
My research is centered around the application of data science and machine learning techniques to solve complex problems in engineering, with a particular emphasis on signal processing and time-series analysis. Throughout my academic and professional career, I have applied advanced methods to analyze and interpret various types of data, including ultrasound and acoustic emission signals, as well as Controller Area Network (CAN) data in automotive systems. My work has involved developing innovative algorithms, such as the Continuous Lag Control (CLC) algorithm for optimizing training data in deep learning models, and applying these techniques to real-world engineering problems, from hybrid electric vehicle diagnostics to non-destructive testing in civil engineering. The integration of signal processing with machine learning methods has been a critical component of my research, enabling more accurate and reliable predictions and improving system diagnostics in diverse domains.

My research has evolved significantly across my academic and professional career, with each phase contributing to my expertise in data science, machine learning, and system diagnostics. During my PhD in Industrial Engineering at New Mexico State University (NMSU), I focused on predicting the State of Charge (SOC) in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). My dissertation work involved using deep learning techniques, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to improve SOC prediction. I developed a Continuous Lag Control (CLC) algorithm to dynamically adjust the training data size during Time-Series Cross Validation (TSCV), optimizing model performance.

After completing my PhD, I joined the Civil Engineering Department at NMSU as a postdoc, where I worked in the Non-Destructive Evaluation Lab. There, I applied data science methods to analyze acoustic emission and ultrasound signals for material defect detection. This research contributed to robotic inspection and additive manufacturing, utilizing advanced signal processing techniques to enhance quality control and structural integrity assessment.

In my second postdoc at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), I worked in the Computer Science and Mathematics Department as a data scientist, where my focus shifted towards automotive cyber-physical systems. I worked extensively with Controller Area Network (CAN) data, applying machine learning methods and Time-Series Cross Validation (TSCV) to fault detection. This research aimed to improve real-time diagnostic capabilities for vehicle networks, helping to predict and identify faults in a timely manner to enhance system reliability.
