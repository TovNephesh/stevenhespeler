Hello! I'm Steven Hespeler, welcome to my personal page! I recently completed my doctoral degree at New Mexico State University. Here, you'll find some information about me like my research interests, professional CV, publications, and more. Thank you for visiting and please contact me with any inquires!! Have a great day!!

## My Research and Work
During my PhD at New Mexico State University, my dissertation centered on the use of deep learning to predict the State of Charge (SOC) in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). I tackled the challenge of time-dependent, evolving data by developing a Continuous Lag Control (CLC) algorithm, which adjusts the size of training data during Time-Series Cross Validation (TSCV). This approach was integrated into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, allowing for more accurate SOC predictions and better energy management in electric vehicles. This work marked the beginning of my interest in applying machine learning techniques to dynamic, real-time systems.

Building on this foundation, my first postdoc shifted my focus to cybersecurity and anomaly detection in automotive and cyber-physical systems (CPS). I contributed to several papers on intrusion detection systems (IDS) for Controller Area Network (CAN) communication, focusing on real-time monitoring of cyber threats. I developed methodologies for handling evolving attack patterns and real-time fault detection, co-authoring works that explored how adaptive learning models could be used to protect automotive systems from cyberattacks. A key part of my work was the development of real-world datasets like ROAD (Real ORNL Automotive Dynamometer), which supported the evaluation of IDS methods in realistic settings.

In my second postdoc, I expanded on these ideas, diving deeper into adaptive learning systems for real-time diagnostics in CPS. I focused on supervised learning models that could quickly adapt to changes in system behavior, detecting faults and anomalies as they occurred. This phase of my research bridged my earlier work in cybersecurity with practical applications in automotive CPS, further advancing the use of machine learning in real-time fault detection and system diagnostics. Through these experiences, I have consistently sought to develop systems that not only learn from historical data but can also adapt to changing conditions and evolving threats.
